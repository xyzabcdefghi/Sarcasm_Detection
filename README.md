# Sarcasm_Detection
This repository contains a sarcasm detection model implemented using various machine learning algorithms. The goal of the project is to accurately classify newspaper headlines as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
# Features: 
Implemented using the following machine learning algorithms:
->Logistic Regression
->Support Vector Machine (SVM)
->Random Forest
->Naive Bayes Multinomial
->Gaussian Naive Bayes
->Utilizes natural language processing techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
